Common Troubleshooting Issues
=============================

This section contains some common problems and how to fix them.

General Issues
--------------

Member unreachable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Check if the member's details in IXP Manager matches with what the member
actually has.

The most important ones are:

- MAC Address
- IPv4/6 Address
- Port connection matches where the member's connection is

A common scenario is a member performed maintenance and their MAC changed
without notification.


Members lost traffic right after deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the unlikely case that members lose traffic right after a deployment, make
use of the rollback function. To start the rollback process, click
``File`` -> ``Rollback Cerberus config``. This restores the configuration on the
switches to the last working config. By default, the failed configuration will
be saved to ``/etc/cerberus/failed/``. This makes it easier to troubleshoot
and debug issues at a later time.

Issues in Miru
--------------

Miru not showing up on the sidebar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Miru is not on the sidebar, you most likely missed a step in the
:ref:`Miru <miru-install>` installation process. Follow the below checklist to
ensure everything is configured correctly. If things are missing, please follow
the install instructions for :ref:`Miru <miru-install>`.

- The ``belthazaar`` folder exists in ``${IXPROOT}/vendor/``
  - If not, Miru was not installed. Follow all the instructions for the :ref:`install <miru-install>`.
- That the ``miru`` folder exists in ``${IXPROOT}/resources/skins/``
- Ensure that ``$IXPROOT/.env`` has the following config set in it ``VIEW_SKIN=miru``
- Ensure that ``${IXPROOT}/public/mxgraph`` exists
- Ensure that ``${IXPROOT}/config/custom.php``has ``Athos`` set
- Ensure that ``${IXPROOT}/config/custom.php``has ``Cerberus`` set


Switches not showing up in Miru
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure that there are switches configured within IXP Manager
- Ensure that the switches are configured as active

"Undefined" links when connecting 2 switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This occurs if there are no core ports designated between the two designated
switches. To designate switch ports on the sidebar go to
``Switches`` â†’ ``Switch Ports``. Choose a switch in the top right corner.
On the right of the port you want to change, click on the pencil icon to edit
the interface. Change the port ``Type`` to ``Core``.

"error saving config"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permission error for saving the configuration. Follow the steps in
`Athos troubleshoot <athos_troubleshoot>`_ to ensure permissions are
configured correctly.

This error is only when storing the config directly and you are not using the
athos api


No output when running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check Athos logs, the issue is most likely due to a failure detected in testing
that is taking too long to report back to Miru.

.. _no_deploy:

No option to deploy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure that ``${IXPROOT}/config/custom.php``has ``cerberus`` and its
  ``api_url`` is configured properly


.. _athos_troubleshoot:

Athos
-----

The best way to troubleshoot athos is by running the athos docker container
outside of IXP Manager.

First ensure that you have the docker image for athos by running:

``docker images belthazaar/athos``

The latest image can also be pulled with ``docker image pull belthazaar/athos``.

Within ``$ATHOSROOT`` run ``runDocker.sh`` as root.

This will start the athos docker container and run the tests of the last given
topology.

If you are using the athos wrapper api, ensure that it is running with
``systemctl status athos_api.service``. If it is not running, run
``systemctl start athos_api.service``.

If you are not using the Athos wrapper API, ensure that your `$MY_WWW_USER`` has
permission to run the ``runDocker.sh`` script within ``$ATHOSROOT`` and has read
and write permissions at minimum within the following locations:

- ``$ATHOSROOT/etc``
- ``$ATHOSROOT/ixpman_files``

Cerberus
--------

- First step is to ensure that Cerberus is running and using the latest version.
  Check the version with ``cerberus-controller --version`` and check it matches
  the latest version.

- Ensure that the Cerberus controller is running, if you have it setup as service
  check its status with ``sudo systemctl status cerberus.service``.

- Check configurations are set properly. The default configurations are:
  * ``/etc/cerberus/topology.json``
  * ``/etc/cerberus/failed/`` - Failed configurations location
  * ``/etc/cerberus/rollback/`` - Rollback configurations location

- Check the logs in ``/var/log/cerberus/cerberus.log``
